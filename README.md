  <strong>A website template that turns Claude Code into your web developer.</strong><br>
  Create a repo, type <code>/onboard</code>, answer a few questions — done. No coding required.
</p>

---

## Quick Start

```
1. Click "Use this template" on GitHub → create your repo
2. Clone it and open with Claude Code
3. Type /onboard
```

That's it. Claude asks about your business, sets up your site, and hands you a working website.

**Going live?** Type `/deploy` — Claude walks you through Cloudflare Pages (free). Every push to `main` auto-deploys after that.

## Staying Current

passionfruit is a one-shot template — your project is yours once it's scaffolded. But passionfruit itself keeps evolving (new components, design improvements, security fixes), and you can pull those in whenever you want.

**The Claude-driven way (recommended):**

```
Check passion4it-gmbh/passionfruit/releases for versions newer than
ours. Pull in the newsletter signup component from the latest release
and adapt it to our brand colors.
```

Claude fetches the relevant files from the latest release, adapts them to your codebase, and wires them in. You only adopt what's useful.

**The git-native way:**

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/passion4it-gmbh/passionfruit.git
git fetch upstream main
git log HEAD..upstream/main --oneline       # see what's new
git cherry-pick <sha>                        # pick a specific change
```

Expect conflicts on `src/i18n/*.json`, `src/lib/page-registry.ts`, and `src/content/` — those are your business content, keep your version.

Watch [Releases](https://github.com/passion4it-gmbh/passionfruit/releases) (click "Watch" → "Custom" → "Releases" on the repo) to get notified when there's something worth adopting.

## For Developers

passionfruit uses a **page registry** (`src/lib/page-registry.ts`) that drives routing, i18n slug mapping, and hreflang generation. All pages go through a single catch-all route — no scattered files in `src/pages/`.

Content lives in `src/content/` as Markdown collections (blog, team, pages), paired across locales via a `translationKey` frontmatter field. A pre-build script enforces bilingual symmetry.

**Key references:**

- [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) — project conventions, architecture, commands
- [`STYLE_GUIDE.md`](./STYLE_GUIDE.md) — design system: colors, typography, components, animations
- [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) — content workflows for blog, team, and pages

**Commands:**

```bash
pnpm dev              # Dev server at localhost:4321
pnpm build            # Production build (lint + typecheck + bilingual check)
pnpm check:all        # Full CI suite locally
pnpm generate-image   # GPT Image generation (needs OPENAI_API_KEY)
```
