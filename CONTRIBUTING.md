# Contributing

Content workflows for the passionfruit template. All content is bilingual (DE + EN) unless a single-locale setup was chosen during `/onboard`.

---

## Blog Posts

**Path:** `src/content/blog/{de,en}/<slug>.md`

**Frontmatter:**

```yaml
---
translationKey: my-post # Same value in both locale files
title: "Post title"
description: "Short description for meta tags and cards"
publishedAt: 2026-01-15
author: "Author Name"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
featured: false # Optional, default false
heroImage: "./_images/hero.jpg" # Optional, relative to file
---
```

Always create both `de/<slug>.md` and `en/<slug>.md` with matching `translationKey`.

## Team Members

**Path:** `src/content/team/{de,en}/<slug>.md`

**Frontmatter:**

```yaml
---
translationKey: jane-doe
name: "Jane Doe"
role: "Lead Designer"
displayOrder: 1 # Lower = appears first
specializations: ["UX", "Brand"] # Optional, default []
photo: "./_images/jane.jpg" # Optional
socials: # Optional
  linkedin: "https://linkedin.com/in/janedoe"
  github: "https://github.com/janedoe"
  website: "https://janedoe.com"
---
```

## Pages

**Path:** `src/content/pages/{de,en}/<slug>.md`

**Frontmatter:**

```yaml
---
translationKey: about
title: "About Us"
description: "Learn more about our team and mission"
heroImage: "./_images/about-hero.jpg" # Optional
---
```

After creating a new page, also:

1. Add a component in `src/components/pages/`
2. Add an entry to the `PAGES` array in `src/lib/page-registry.ts` with `{ de, en }` slugs
3. Add navigation items in Header and Footer if needed

## Translations (i18n)

**Files:** `src/i18n/de.json` and `src/i18n/en.json`

- Nested key structure: `{ "section": { "key": "value" } }`
- Access via `t('section.key')` from `useTranslations(locale)`
- Always update both files in the same commit
- German is primary market — ensure DE translations are polished, not just machine-translated
